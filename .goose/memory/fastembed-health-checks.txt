âœ… COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CHECK ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Docker Container Boundary Aware Health Checking System

Successfully implemented a comprehensive health check system that properly addresses Docker/Kubernetes container boundary concerns:

### Key Components Implemented:

1. **Health Check Configuration System** (`src/health/health_config.py`)
   - Environment-based configuration with container awareness
   - Different check levels: BASIC, DETAILED, DIAGNOSTIC
   - Response formats: JSON, Prometheus, TEXT
   - Container threshold management (CPU, memory, disk, GPU)
   - Configurable timeouts and grace periods

2. **Container Health Monitor** (`src/health/container_health.py`)
   - Detects container runtime: Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, or Host
   - Reads resource limits from cgroups v1/v2
   - Monitors resource usage with container-specific context
   - OOM (Out-Of-Memory) risk detection
   - Container metadata extraction (pod name, namespace, etc.)

3. **Comprehensive Health Checker** (`src/health/health_checker.py`)
   - Layered health checking with different detail levels
   - Component-based health assessment (gRPC, model, Qdrant, resources, CUDA)
   - Container boundary aware status determination
   - Startup grace period handling
   - Actionable recommendations generation

4. **Enhanced HTTP Server** (`src/http_server_enhanced.py`)
   - Multiple health endpoints for different use cases:
     - `/health` - Basic health check (Docker HEALTHCHECK compatible)
     - `/health/detailed` - Detailed status for monitoring systems
     - `/health/diagnostic` - Full diagnostic info for troubleshooting
     - `/readiness` - Kubernetes readiness probe
     - `/liveness` - Kubernetes liveness probe  
     - `/metrics/health` - Prometheus metrics format

5. **Docker Health Check Script** (`docker-health-check.sh`)
   - Comprehensive health check script with container boundary awareness
   - Multiple check levels: basic, detailed, diagnostic
   - Kubernetes probe support (readiness/liveness)
   - Verbose output for troubleshooting
   - Container environment detection

6. **Enhanced Dockerfile**
   - Multi-layer HEALTHCHECK with fallback options
   - Proper timeout and retry configuration
   - Health check dependencies added (psutil, GPUtil)
   - Container-optimized startup grace periods

### Container Boundary Solutions Addressed:

1. **Resource Constraint Detection**
   - Reads actual container limits from cgroups
   - Differentiates between container limits and host limits
   - OOM risk assessment based on container boundaries
   - GPU memory monitoring in containerized environments

2. **Environment-Aware Health Checks**
   - Detects Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, or host environments
   - Adapts health check behavior based on container runtime
   - Container metadata extraction (pod name, namespace, node)
   - Different health standards for different environments

3. **Layered Health Check Strategy**
   - **Basic**: Port listening + connectivity (for Docker HEALTHCHECK)
   - **Detailed**: Component health + resource usage (for monitoring)
   - **Diagnostic**: Full system state + recommendations (for troubleshooting)

4. **Startup Phase Handling**
   - Grace period during container startup
   - Different health expectations during startup vs runtime
   - Model loading awareness in containerized environments
   - Progressive health validation

5. **External vs Internal Health Perspectives**
   - Load balancer ready checks (basic)
   - Monitoring system detailed checks
   - Kubernetes probe specific endpoints
   - Container orchestration aware responses

### Development Integration:

- Updated `dev.sh` with health check testing commands:
  - `./dev.sh run-http-enhanced` - Run server with enhanced health checks
  - `./dev.sh test-health` - Test the health check system
  - `./dev.sh demo-health` - Demo health check functionality

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Container boundary aware health checking
./docker-health-check.sh --level detailed --verbose
./docker-health-check.sh --readiness
./docker-health-check.sh --liveness

# Different health endpoints for different consumers
curl http://localhost:8080/health              # Load balancers
curl http://localhost:8080/health/detailed     # Monitoring systems  
curl http://localhost:8080/health/diagnostic   # Troubleshooting
curl http://localhost:8080/readiness           # Kubernetes readiness
curl http://localhost:8080/liveness            # Kubernetes liveness
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics/health      # Prometheus metrics
```

This implementation provides production-ready health checking that properly accounts for the Docker container boundary, making it suitable for Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and standalone Docker deployments while maintaining excellent observability and debugging capabilities.
