âœ… HTTP SERVER WITH OBSERVABILITY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (June 18th, 2025)

FastEmbed HTTP Server v2.0 now has full observability integration with structured logging and request correlation.

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. **Complete HTTP Server with Observability** (src/http_server.py)
   - Full request correlation with unique request IDs
   - Comprehensive error handling with structured logging
   - Operation context tracking for all gRPC calls
   - Performance timing for all endpoints
   - CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
   - Custom exception handlers with proper logging

2. **Request Correlation Middleware**
   - Automatic request ID generation for every HTTP request
   - Request timing and performance metrics
   - Client IP and User-Agent tracking
   - Response headers with correlation IDs (X-Request-ID)

3. **Operation Context Integration**
   - Wraps all gRPC client operations with context tracking
   - Proper error propagation with correlation
   - File processing workflow logging
   - Model operations monitoring

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - HTTP exceptions with structured logging
   - General exception handler with full stack traces
   - Proper error correlation across request boundaries
   - gRPC error translation and logging

5. **Development Tools Integration**
   - Added run-http-obs command to dev.sh
   - Test script for HTTP observability (test_http_observability.py)
   - Demo client for observability features (demo_http_observability.py)

6. **Fixed Operation Context Bug**
   - Resolved keyword argument collision with 'duration' parameter
   - Proper context management for nested operations
   - Error handling preserves full context information

ENDPOINTS WITH OBSERVABILITY:
- GET / - Root endpoint with version info
- POST /embeddings - Text embedding generation with full tracking
- POST /process-file - File upload and processing with workflow logging
- GET /status - Server status with operation context
- GET /models - Model listing with context tracking
- GET /health - Health check with timing
- POST /update-model-config - Model configuration updates

OBSERVABILITY FEATURES:
- Request correlation IDs in all logs
- Operation timing and performance metrics
- Error correlation and stack trace preservation
- Client information tracking (IP, User-Agent)
- File processing workflow monitoring
- gRPC operation tracking and error translation
- Structured JSON log format for machine consumption
- Text format for human-readable development

CONFIGURATION:
- Environment-based logging configuration (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_OUTPUT)
- File output with rotation support
- Console and remote logging options
- Full integration with existing observability infrastructure

USAGE:
- Development: ./dev.sh run-http-obs
- Production: python src/http_server.py
- Testing: python demo_http_observability.py
- Configuration: Set LOG_* environment variables

NEXT STEPS READY:
- Phase 2: Prometheus metrics integration
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Advanced alerting integration
- Dashboard configuration

The HTTP server now provides production-ready observability with excellent developer experience, making it easy to monitor, debug, and troubleshoot issues in both development and production environments.
