# observability, prometheus, logging, metrics, fastembed, monitoring
FastEmbed Server Observability Implementation Plan created at /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/fastembed-qdrant/OBSERVABILITY_PLAN.md

Plan includes:
- Phase 1: Enhanced Logging System (structured JSON logging, request context tracking)
- Phase 2: Prometheus Metrics Integration (request metrics, business metrics, system resources)
- Phase 3: Implementation Architecture (directory structure, configuration, dependencies)
- Phase 4: Deployment Integration (Docker, Kubernetes, log aggregation)
- Phase 5: Dashboard and Alerting (Grafana dashboards, alert rules)

Key files to implement:
- src/observability/logger.py - Structured logging with request context
- src/observability/metrics.py - Prometheus metrics definitions
- src/observability/middleware.py - gRPC/HTTP interceptors
- Environment variables for LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, METRICS_ENABLED, etc.

Dependencies to add: prometheus-client, structlog, python-json-logger

Next step: Start with Phase 1 (Enhanced Logging) as foundation
